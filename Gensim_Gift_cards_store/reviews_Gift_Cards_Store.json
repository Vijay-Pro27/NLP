This was not true in my experience.  I guess a glitch, which is fine, but I didn't catch it until it was too late.  Don't make the same mistake.  Please be aware at checkout that your gift card may not be applied to your purchase.  If you do not see the gift card balance subtracted from your order total, do not place your order.  Call customer service.  I foolishly assumed that even though I did not see the gift card balance being subtracted from my order, that it indeed would be, so placed the order anyway.  Now Amazon says it is too late for them to correct this and I will have to use the gift card on my next purchase.

It's kind of annoying that they assume I want to make another purchase.

Note to all those who think that everything on the Amazon.com website is sold by Amazon: well, it is not. Since the gift card is an AMAZON gift card, why should it work on items that are just sold through Amazon.com? Those companies are paying a premium to Amazon to sell on Amazon's website. There are many, many item that are sold by Amazon and the gift card/certificate redeemed will work on those items. To me, the cards/certificates have worked perfectly as advertised.An easy way to find just Amazon.com products is to search as if you were and Amazon Prime customer. Amazon Prime customers get free 2 day shipping on Amazon product only, so, Amazon gift dollars will work on those items. Also, on those items, I have used a card for 100% of the purchase making it so that from my point of view, the product was free, as if the person who gave me the gift dollars actually purchased the product for me. Also, I must note that there are some third party items that will allow an Amazon gift dollars to be used. Unfortunately you may only notice at checkout.There are a few things that are easily overlooked:- The redeemer must have an account with credit card in the system.- Cards from third parties are not consistent. I have and never will purchase a card from a third party.

Yes, on Halloween, someone thought it was a good idea to leave a gift card on my front door step, probably right next to the bowl of candy we had out for the trick or treaters. We were trick or treating with our own kids. Who does this? Why would a gift card be delivered to a doorstep? What is Amazon thinking using the company OnTrac? Terrible!

The only info on it is the date and time (I was home at the time they said they placed this on my door also) and \"Come by to see the package.\" Are you kidding me? Come by where? There is no other identifying info on the door tag. I tried OnTrac's website, nothing. I called the 800 number. After finally getting a human being (you can't just hit 0 for an operator), the first question she asks me is \"Did you call about a package you're missing?\" Ummm, why would you even think that in the first place? I have yet to give you any identifying information and that's the first thing you think I'm calling about? When I said I was calling about this cryptic door tag, she tells me the door tag must have been placed on the wrong door. When I further explained the situation, she says Oh, that just means that the driver came back by and looked for the missing package and couldn't find it. The whole thing is just shady.

I did this without reading the many negative comments about this product, and sure wish I had done so before ordering.  I would have jumped in my car and gone to the local Barnes and Noble to buy one.I received an almost instantaneous acknowledgement of the order, which, of course, noted that my credit card had been charged.  Since Amazon says gift certificates are delivered immediately, I expected my husband's to arrive as quickly as the confirmation.  But nothing, as of 10 pm.I checked email about 9 this morning and nothing had been sent.  So I contacted Amazon customer service.  Finally, at about 4 p.m. today (nearly 24 hours later) the gift certificate arrived, though I can't be sure this was as a result of my message to customer service.What a confusing thing this gift certificate is!As the donor, I received the acknowledgement of the order mentioned earlier and a copy of the gift certificate.  It contained a lengthy reference number to use if I experience problems using the gift certificate (see below for more numbers relating to this cerfiticate).  I'm not the one who will be using it, so I am not sure why this information was conveyed to me.My husband, the recipient, received 2 e-mail messsages.  One told him that he had received an Amazon gift certificate, gave him a link to use to view it, and told him he would shortly receive another email message contianing a \"Gift certificate claim code\".  That message arrived about 25 minutes later and it contains way too many numbers and ways of redeeming the gift certificate.  There is a claim code, an order number, an \"expires\" date of 07-jul-2008 and a \"spend by\" date of 07-jan-2008.  (Shouldn't those 2 dates be the same?)He is told that he can shop at Amazon, place items in a cart, and order them using the gift certificate.  Or, if he wants to redeem his gift certificate, but is \"just not ready to make a purchase\", he can click on a link and \"deposit\" said gift certificate \"for future use\".  (Does Amazon pay interest, like a bank?!?!?)  If he's not ready to shop, why would he want to redeem his gift certigicate now?  What's wrong with him keeping it until he is ready?  Or will it disappear into the ether if he doesn't \"deposit\" it?  From other reviews I read, it sounds as if this is something that could easily happen.  He thinks he'll spend it all at one time, another wise move, given some of the comments.I have a masters degree in library science and spend much of my working life finding and analyzing information.  The various messages about this gift certificate are confusing even to me.I've ordered Amazon gift certificates in the past, with no problems at all.  They came quickly, they were easy to use.  But it had been at least 6 months since I have done so.  What happened, Amazon?  Is this some new and supposedly improved system?  If it is, go back to the old one.  It worked.Then there are the 16 \"terms and conditions\", some with links to offer up yet more babble, plus a footnote to wade through.

This way I knew to look for it, and was able to print it out and give away.

Yes the e-mail certificate does in fact get auto generated and sent out within minutes, but amazon.com could avoid a lot of problems by either changing the source e-mail address of the certificate, or at least giving a heads-up in their product description to let people know to search in their junk mail folder for a message containing \"amazon.com\" in the subject line.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It works if you know what to watch out for", "unixReviewTime": 1135468800, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2005"}

We decided we were going to split it 50/50 -- half for something I wanted, half for something he wanted.My husband chose what he wanted to buy for himself first, added it to his Amazon shopping cart and went to the online checkout. The item cost about $120, so he was going to use $50 from his half of the gift voucher and pay the rest with a credit card. I hadn't decided what to purchase for myself yet, but we figured during the checkout process that we could simply designate only $50 be used for the purchase being made at that time, then the remaining $50 would be there when I wanted to redeem it later on.BIG MISTAKE.This is where we learned the hard way the importance of paying attention when placing an order and thoroughly reading the fine print. In part, it says:#5 - Any unused balance will be placed in the recipient's gift certificate account and is not transferable. The original expiration date will apply to any unused balance.#6 - If your order exceeds the amount of your gift certificate, you must pay for the balance with a credit card.We understood both of these points. But what we didn't realize was that we couldn't personally designate HOW MUCH the unused balance would be when we redeemed the gift voucher. My husband kept clicking through the checkout stages, thinking at some point that he'd be asked what amount he wanted to redeem from his gift voucher for that purchase. We've partially redeemed online gift vouchers this way on other sites, so we just assumed Amazon, the Mother of All Online Stores, would have that feature. Well, before he knew it, the order was placed, the entire $100 voucher had been redeemed and his wife, ME, was pretty steamed about being shafted out of her $50 gift!So, now we know: Amazon does NOT offer customers the opportunity to partially redeem their gift vouchers when they want to (unless the total purchase price is less than the gift voucher amount). We don't blame Amazon for this necessarily -- it was our fault for not understanding the fine print. We've never had any other problems with Amazon gift vouchers in the past, which is why I'm giving this review 3 stars. But it was a big disappointment and quite a surprise to discover that Amazon doesn't have this feature. I'm sure we're not the only ones who assumed this was possible, so I figured I'd spread the word to prevent others from being as disappointed as I was/am. :(My advice is two-fold: 1) If you receive a joint Amazon gift voucher, wait until you've BOTH decided what you want and place ONE order together; and 2) If you are thinking of giving a couple/family a joint Amazon gift voucher, DON'T.

Obviously I can only speak of my own experience, but it's unfortunate that so many people have been unhappy with the puchase and delivery of their gift certificate.  The lead reviewer points out some of the possible problems (spam filter inadvertently blocks it, etc.) and how to get around them; I'd advise reading this if you have any hesitations.That said, I have to report that I've had no problems with Amazon.com gift certificates (and no, I don't work for them). I've used them three times, most recently yesterday.  The e-card (with a photo provided by Amazon, a message by me, and the code to use the gift certificate) arrived on time.A few complaints and pointers, albeit fairly minor:1. ALthough Amazon.com points this out, DO NOT hit the back button to edit your message--you will lose it, and have to start from scratch.  While this is ostensibly done for security reasons, some websites will retain some of the message rather than erase it all.  I'd like it if Amazon would BOLD or increase the font of their warning.2. YOu can choose whether you want music to accompany your message; however, it does not appear you can choose the music.  The selection offered with my birthday present didn't fit the theme; in fact, I'm not sure what it would go with.3. Oncve you've chosen a picture, you're stuck with it; you can't hit \"edit\" and change it.  Again, this is based on my experience yesterday, so this MIGHT have been a temporary problem. If not, and you're not sending a simple greeting, try to make sure you like the picture you've chosen (out of an fairly limited selection).4. The main thing, I think, is that your gift certificate arrives to the intended recipient in a timely manner. One would also like a receipt, and Amazon automatically email this to you. For those who have problems, there are a few remedies.  Unfortuantely, it is very difficult to reach Amazon.com by telephone; they seem to make every effort to hide this so that you'll email Customer Service.  On the other hand, Customer Service has always been prompt with other problems.  ANOTHER solution:  Call your credit company (Visa, or whatever), and report non-delivery as a type of fraud:  YOu paid for something and did not receive it.  Most companies will not require you to pay until they have investigated the matter.Again, I cannot speak to everyone's circumstances, but I'd like to add a more optimistic note to the flood of criticism here.  Some skeptics might question whether all of these complaints are truthful, but there's no way to determine that just from readng the reviews.

I have also sent them to other people and they, too, received them okay.With that being said, please be aware that some Internet Service Provider email programs and many school and company email programs/firewalls may think the Amazon Gift Certificate email is spam.  If that is the case it will go into the recipients spam folder, or the firewall may not let it by at all.  This actually happened to me this past Christmas when someone sent me an Amazon certificate to my AOL account.  My friend called me a week or so later to see if I had received it.  I looked in my spam folder and there it was.  I have since changed my spam filter on AOL to make sure those come through to my inbox now.Also, please keep in mind that if for some reason the person you are sending to doesn't receive it and can't find it in their spam folder (or they are not sure how to check) you can do two other things:One is to resend it, but to a different email address.  Just make sure it is a different address at a different Internet Service Provider.  In other words, if you sent to an AOL email account and it didn't go through try sending to another email account like Yahoo if they have one.  Most people have more than one email account these days.Please note that if you do resend it you will not be charged again.  You can resend - even to a different email address if need be - until the certificate is redeemed.Two, you can have a paper certificate sent in regular mail.  Slower, but still fun to get one of those too.  They all spend the same.If you do have problems contact customer service.  I did once when a shipping company - not Amazon itself - lost a book I ordered.  Customer Service was great and they sent a replacement to me overnight.  I received the replacement no problem.I have used Amazon since 1998.  I am on the West Coast and most of my family is on the East Coast.  I have spent a lot at Amazon over the past 9 years sending gifts back there, and ordering things for myself like books and DVDs.  It's been a really good experience for me, but stuff happens.

You can print it. You can save it and forward it to your intended recipient on any date that you like. Given that the important piece of information is the confirmation number, you can even find or construct a \"greeting\" card of your own and write or \"Photoshop\" the number onto the image before sending it to someone.

(The confirmation email that Amazon sends you as the purchaser does not include the confirmation number.)You *can* recover the information after placing your order, however, by visiting \"Your Account\" and viewing the order detail. There's a link there to resend the certificate with an option to send it again to the original recipient or to send it to another email address that you can enter. So you can still have Amazon send the certificate directly to the recipient then go back and send yourself a \"copy\" just to make sure you have the information yourself.Nevertheless, I do agree that Amazon could have made this process somewhat easier by including a \"print certificate now\" option. The iTunes store does this and constructs web page that renders a fairly good-looking certificate that you can print or screen-capture and email or whatever. The lack of that feature is why this service rates just 4 stars.That and the issues with \"fine print\", particularly the restriction that you can't use a certificate to buy another certificate, which would be a way around the 18-month limitation.

He had only wanted to send one and purchased it.  However, he was getting conflicting instructions from the website.  To make a long story short, he re-entered the information only to discovery that his bank account had been charged for two certificates, each for the same amount.  That was only the beginning of his problem.Our anniversary came and no email notification that I had been given any gift certificates from Amazon.  My husband called Amazon customer service and they explained that somehow he managed to order two of them.  OK, no problem, he said that he would give me two instead of one (bless his heart).Well, time past and still I receive no notification of any certificates.  Then, sometime yesterday, I get an email that there is an e-card for me.  I opened it up and it indicated a gift certificate would be forthcoming in another email.  It took another day for the actual certificate with the amount and claim number to appear.Now today I get a second e-card stating I will receive a gift certificate in another email.  Well, you guessed it--the other gift certificate has yet to appear.Did Amazon decide to turn over the function of gift certificates to another company?  If so, it is a HUGE mistake.  My husband has tried to get the ball rolling but to no avail.  Nobody seems to be able to do anything.So far I have gotten two e-cards and one certificate and am still waiting for the second one.  We have NEVER had this problem before.  If we indicated that a certificate be sent to someone even on the same day as ordered, there it was, with no problem whatsoever.  Now they seem lost in limbo somewhere.The whole thing is a sad joke.  What was to be an anniversary gift turned out to be a big disapointment for us both.

They say that if you just buy the certificates THIS way and send them THAT way, everything is fine. But the problem is that, clearly, not every method of sending this certificates works as smoothly, and you shouldn't have to jump through hoops and make sure you buy and send in a specific way to make sure everything works properly.Here's the deal. I bought eight e-cards for my co-workers. I set up seven to deilver on the 22nd and one to deliver on the 20th, for a colleague who was leaving early for a Christmas trip home. But then I found out that another of my co-workers was leaving early, too, so I wanted to see if I could change the delivery date on one of the certificates slated for the 22nd. The customer service rep said ALL of the cards had already been sent. I explained that I set them up for later delivery. He put me on hold, checked the site, said he didn't even know Amazon offered that option, apologized, and said the certificates had already been sent. So what good is setting up a delayed delivery date?After further back-and-forth communication, I was also told that there was a \"technical error\" and that my certificates were sent without the e-cards that I had picked out. This was after customer service told me that I DIDN'T order e-cards, which I most certainly did.Ultimately, none of the certificates sent when they were supposed to. I had to send out an email to my colleagues at the end of the day on the 22nd telling them that they had gift certificates coming but that Amazon had botched the order. See, you'd think that if you selected delivery for the 22nd, the cards would arrive at some point during the day of the 22nd, right? Well, I got email comfirmation of delivery on these certificates in my mailbox ... time-stamped at 3 a.m. on the ***23rd***. That equates to midnight of the 22nd on the West Coast ... the VERY END of the 22nd. So keep in mind that if you select a later delivery date for your gift certificates and e-cards, they'll be sent at the very end of that day, not ON that day. The result for me was that nobody got their gifts until after Christmas, since we didn't convene again until the 26th and had already gone home for the weekend before the certifcates ever arrived.I use Amazon a lot, and it's reliable in almost every other aspect. I'm even a shareholder.

I would like a confirmation that the product ordered reached its destination, and would like to know a possible date for delivery. It also doesn't show up in recent orders, this should have the same order process as all other orders and just because it is a gift certificate its still should be treated like any other order.Another thing is that there is a resend option if your recipient does not receive the product by mail, but since I sent it to my address to give personally on x-mas I didn't have to use that option. Considering that you cannot track it I don't see the point of this option, because you could keep having to resend it.

Since I read some of the negative reviews, though, I thought I'd post a couple thoughts:1.  If you want to print the gift card the same day you buy it, just send it to yourself in an e-card and print from there. No biggie.  (You can also do that if you want to send just the claim code to someone in a different e-card or e-mail, btw--just be sure it's someone who knows how to use it.)2. *Most* people have e-mail filters of some kind. Mail from Amazon may get marked as junk mail, or may even be blocked. Don't send a gift card to a work e-mail address (it's probably not work-related mail anyway, and that e-mail account belongs to the employer, not your sister-in-law or whomever). Even Amazon can't force a delivery to an e-mail account that automatically directs all Amazon mail to a junk folder, or worse, blocks the sender altogether. A surprising number of people set their e-mail to accept messages only from known senders, too.  (Hotmail, for example, offers this option and LOTS of spam if you don't take it.)To overcome this problem, I'd recommend (a) NOT using a spammy subject line like \"A Gift for You,\" (b)checking with your recipient before sending to make sure the e-mail address is active, and (c) sending the gift certificate to yourself and then remailing from your personal account if there's any doubt about your recipient's e-mail account accepting/rejecting it.3. I don't know about Amazon for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if, right around the holidays, their servers get as busy as the lines at the mall.  A gift certificate sent on Christmas Eve, for example, might take a matter of hours to go through instead of minutes. (Forgive the guess, please, Amazon, if I'm wrong here.)4. Check your own e-mail settings to be sure that *you'll* receive mail from Amazon. Before you send your card, you may want to disable blocked senders altogether, for example. In general, I prefer directing junk mail to a junk mail folder where I can look it over quickly before it's tossed away. If you do this, and also check that folder and all others carefully before emptying them, you won't miss whatever mail Amazon sends.Just a few thoughts . . .", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tips for Immediate Printing, Lost e-Cards, etc.", "unixReviewTime": 1129939200, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2005"}

It is not the same though as the nice looking certificate shown on the web page but it will work.According to the email message with the code from Amazon, the GC's are actually issued and sold by A2Z Gift Certificates, Inc..  I am assuming there is sometimes a problem with this company getting the information or emailing the certificates - who knows but if you decide to get a GC, email it to yourself to make sure it arrives and if you need it right away but do not get it in a reasonable amount of time, say 4-6 hours, contact Amazon Customer Service using the Call Back option so they can help you out with a work-around to make sure your gift recipient at least has the code number so they can use it.  Please note that during the order process you do not get the GC code so without the certificate or the email with the code, you will have no record of what the code is, which is needed for the recipient to make a purchase with the GC.1st post 12/23 - After reading the reviews, I decided to send the email gift certificate to myself. I know for a fact there are no email filters that will prevent me from receiveing it. It has been nearly 12 hours since I ordered and I have not yet received it. I contacted customer service a few minutes ago (btw, the callback option worked great!) and was told it is policy that the the certificate will arrive within 24 hours. My son's birthday is tomorrow so IF it does arrive today, no problem but if you are considering this for a last minute Christmas present, do not think you will get it within a couple of minutes or a few hours, it could be much longer.  I don't get what the problem is that these gift certificates can't be issued as soon as the payment is approved.  I buy often on Amazon and have never had problems so am very surprised they have created such a mess with this.  A 24 hour delay (if I even get it)for a gift certificate is ridiculous!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not for last minute Christmas gift!", "unixReviewTime": 1166832000, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2006"}

It came within 5 days of the purchase, which is a good time considering I used amazon's super free shipping. When it arrived, there was a paper inside that said \"access your gift cards anywhere, anytime with Go Wallet\". On that slip of paper it says current balance is $21.50. THAT IS NOT THE BALANCE OF THE CARD. I realize there is another reviewer that saw this and believed he/she had been ripped off. As soon as I saw the card, I went onto starbucks.com to find out that my card had a balance of $25, which is what I purchased. It was a bad marketing scheme by Gift Card Mall to place that piece of paper in there. But, I'm pretty sure they could be sued if you paid shipping on the item and they still took off money on the card.
